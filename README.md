# PyCodec
Using Python to do some codec mathematics.

This library just do basic algorithm analysis and don't care about speed. The aim of using Python, the first is just for fun, the second is just to familiar Video Coding standards with high level language. By using Python, we can just focus on the theory of video coding. When we read code like x264 or x265, there are too many languange details mixing up with video coding standards which make the code poor to read.

If you are interesting in any module of video coding standards, you can request the part to me and I will find some time to realize it.


# Dependency

[h26x-extractor](https://github.com/slhck/h26x-extractor)

```bash
pip3 install h26x-extractor
```

If we can't install h26x-extractor by the pip3 command, we can also download the package from Github and install it manually.

```bash
python3 setup.py install
